          <div class="title"> The Colorful Richness of Black and White (2018)</div>
          After the first project (I’m not afraid of Bright and Grey Colors), I got really interested in this topic. I could’ve gone in many other directions, but I wanted to continue researching shadows.  <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Shadows" ></span>
          In this project I took the same concept: portraing shadows in a different light. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image2.jpg" class="toggle" alt="Shadows"></span> I decided to trace more shadows from the pictures I took and make sculptures of them. Giving the shadows again their own voice. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Shadows" ></span>
          I chose plexiglass as my medium to portay the shadows. It is see-through but when the light hits te sculptures, you will see yourself in it or the surrounding you find yourself in. It is also much easier to see the shadows as something of their own now. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Shadows" ></span> The form doesn’t change anymore, but the things you see in them will change constantly. I’ve put them in clay to keep the sculptures close to nature as much as possible. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Shadows" ></span> I’ve created a total of seven sculptures in different sizes.

            <div class="title"> Lecture series IAFD & INSIDE (KABK) (2018)</div>
            Made on commission for IAFD & Inside (KABK) in collaboration with Zahari Dimitrov. <span class="image portrait"><img src="images/do_1.jpeg" alt="IAFD + MID Letterpress" ></span> "Ongoing photo project on social media (instagram and facebook), which consists of performative selfies in front of architectural landmarks.  <span class="image portrait"><img src="images/do_5.jpeg" alt="IAFD + MID Letterpress" ></span>
            It all started with a selfie in front of Guggenheim in 2015, where I stated in a comment on instagram and facebook the remarkable resemblance of my expression with the building's design. One of the many commentators - the architect-artist Miriam Rohde - challenged me then with the New Museum. <span class="image portrait"><img src="images/do_3.jpeg" alt="IAFD + MID Letterpress" ></span>  That's how the idea of a series had started. It didn’t stop yet. <span class="image portrait"><img src="images/do_4.jpeg" alt="IAFD + MID Letterpress" ></span> I might end up looking like a million cities." - David Helbich <span class="image portrait"><img src="images/do_2.jpeg" alt="IAFD + MID Letterpress" ></span> With this idea, we decided to give the viewer an souvenir by making small "stampcards" with David's face on it.

          <div class="title">Color Conflict (2018)</div>
          The color conflict of shadows can be that they don’t really have a color. I’ve created this pattern with synonyms of the word ‘shadow’ to emphasize on the fact that they are so versatile. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image2.2.jpg" alt="Wallpaper" ></span>Overlaying the pattern with shadow-like forms, I try to show the beauty of shadows. That’s why they are white instead of black.
          I try to re-use as much as possible of my work. After I made the sculptures I had some spare plexiglass and I really wanted to use it in some way. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image2.3.jpg" alt="Wallpaper" ></span> So I used them as stencils for my tapestry.
          I silkscreened the text and hand-painted the ‘shadows‘ by use of my spare plexiglass on top of the synonyms. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/image2.1.jpg" alt="Wallpaper" ></span> In total I’ve created two cotton tapestries in the size 170 cm x 200 cm.

            Who would you really like to interview? For me it was my dear friend Joris Henstra. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/design4.jpg" alt="printed portrait" ></span>  I've known him for seven years now. He keeps on surprising me, in a good way. I might say I even admire him.  <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/design4.1.jpg" alt="printed portrait" ></span> Such a simple man but so complicated at the same time. How does this happen and what goes on in his mind?
            I'm still not completely sure but it was really nice to talk to him on a deeper level. <span class="image landscape"><img src="images/design4.3.jpg" alt="printed portrait" ></span>
